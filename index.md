### Interesting question 

What is the scientitifc goal?  What would you do if you had all the data?  What do you want to predict or estimate?  Why is this relevant to ABE researchers or the field?  Provide some background on the rationale and relevance.

### Data description

What kind of data is avialble?  How is your data collected?  Are there any concerns about the data?  Which data is the most relevant?  Is the data easy to acccess? Will the data change over time?  What needs to be done to the data to get it ready for any downstream analysis?

### Explore the data

Demonstrate what you would do to describe the data and if it has any patterns or anomolies.  Make some plots.

### Model the data

Build a model, fit the model, validate the model.

### Communciate and visualize the results

What did you learn and do the results make sense?  Revisit your initial question and answer it.  H

### Class Exercise

In each project, I'd like to see a homework assignment that the class can do/evaluate to learn more about your data.  This should be a reproducible notebook that allows them to learn one or more aspects of your data workflow.  It is also an opportunity to share your research with your colleagues.

// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}

GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
